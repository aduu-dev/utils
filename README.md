# Abstract

This repository collects a couple of utility packages I'd like to share. Most notable are:

- `aduu.dev/utils/dash`: executing shell commands by parsing and feeding them into `exe.CMD`
- `aduu.dev/utils/runmanager`: starting multiple services and if one crashes/exists then shut all down
